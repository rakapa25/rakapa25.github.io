## About Me

My name is Riddhavee Kapadia (she/her) '25. I go to Colby College and am a rising junior. I am double majoring in Computational Biology and Spanish, and want to add a data science minor. I'm interested in going into public health, and considering doing further research in the field. 

## About My Mentor

My professor is Rua M. Williams (they/them). As taken from their profile on Purdue, Professor Rua Williams is an Assistant Professor in the User Experience Design program at Purdue University. They are a Just Tech Fellow with the Social Science Research Council. They study interactions between technology design, computing research practices, and Disability Justice. Dr. Williams deploys Feminist and Anti-Racist approaches to Technoscience, Critical disability Studies, and Science and Technology Studies in the design and evaluation of technological systems to simultaneously illustrate injustice in technology as well as marginalized usersâ€™ own practices of resistance through those same technologies.
