Week 7

This week, my professor gave me a new book to read, to help me understand the effect that social media can have on broadening the ability of people to talk about their experiences. I also continued reading papers related to my topic. This week, there was also a celebration for July 4th. I worked on brainstorming ideas for another project my professor was doing on creating accessibility for protests; they try to find creative prompts for participants to help think up ways to improve how accessible protests are. Collected tweets and reddit posts for the samples of my project.
