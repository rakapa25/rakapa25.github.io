Week 7

Professor gave me a new book to read. Went to the celebration for July 4th. I worked on brainstorming ideas for another project my professor was doing on creating accessibility for protests; they try to find creative prompts for participants to help think up ways to improve how accessible protests are. Collected tweets and reddit posts for the samples of my project.
