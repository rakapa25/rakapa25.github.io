Week 3

So this week, I had the chance to continue reading various papers related to my topics of interest. In order to supplement my reading, I also borrowed the book "Race after Technology" by Ruha Benjamin from my professor, which I continued reading. This week, my professor was away for a conference on Japan, so we were working remotely. Alongside reading, I worked on writing journal entries about my visits to the senior center. These journal entries included their overall reactions to technology, how they navigated the steps to fix these problems, and their overall emotional state while explaining the issues they were having/ being explained how to to circumvent them. I also went to the senior center again on Friday.
