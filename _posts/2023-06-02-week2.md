Week 2


So this week, I was able to implement more of the planning process of research. This included reading papers related to topics of interest, forming a research question, getting the necessary search terms to get new papers, and making an annotated bibliography. I also got my Purdue ID set up, so that I could use Purdue libraries and get free access to Linkedin tutorials, which I will be doing to learn about Unity and Arduino. I learned that ACM (Association for Computing Machinery) would have valuable sources, and my professor helped me brainstorm possible topics for my research. They helped me settle on doing a project analyzing tweets and reddits posts on a hashtag #doctorsaredickheads. The project would be on patient-physician relations and how there is a power imbalance and societal view that doctors are always correct, but the hashtag is trying to move patient-physician relationships to evolve and be more patient-centered.  Additionally, I had the chance to go to the Senior Center and volunteer again. It was very wonderful to be able to help elderly people figure out technology.
