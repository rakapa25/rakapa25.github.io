Week 4

So my main goal for this week to make an annotated bibliography of all the sources that I had been reading up on, and their possible relevance to my research project. Additionally, I continued reading up on other papers, and volunteering at the senior home. This week, I also learned more about IRBs from listening to the graduate students under Professor Rua talking about theirs and what they needed in order to fix and complete theirs. My professor told me that I needed to do the training for it so that I could submit one as well for my project. They also helped me plan out the next few weeks (with reference to what I should be doing.) Overall, a good week. Having no other undergraduates in this DREU was a little sad, but I've been talking to students in other REUs at Purdue and we made a group chat as well as plans to go to the farmers market and dinner this weekend.
