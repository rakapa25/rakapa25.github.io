Week 10

This was my final week working with professor Rua, and I spent all of my time just working on my paper and finishing up the data collection so that I can submit my technical paper. I feel like I've learned a lot from this, and have some great contacts now that I can contact about the application process for graduate school! :) I would definitely recommend DREU for any students considering applying, who are reading this currently. No matter where you experience will be located, you definitely learn about what research feels and looks like, and its really nice to have a mentor who has gone through the process as well. Thank you for this experience!
