Week 8

This week, I continued the collection of tweets and reddit posts. Additionally, I read up on editorials and opinion pieces on my hashtag #doctorsaredickheads, and the hashtag that rose as a counter, #patientsaredickheads. With this information, I continued working on my paper and writing out the methods and results sections. My IRB got approved at the end of this week, so I will also be finishing up the survey and interview questions next week to get them approved by my professor! Because of this delay, I anticipate not being able to submit data about the results of my interviews and surveys for the technical paper I am writing for milestone 4, but I will continue working on it afterwards! My last visit to the senior center unfortunately got cancelled this week, as the seniors were being taken for a picnic! I still really enjoyed my week, and started packing to go home. I would be working for the last two weeks from home, because my family lives in India and I wanted to get a month with them before I had to go back to school.
