Week 6

This week, I first completed a course in IRB protocol so that I understood how to write a proposal in order to collect data in the form of surveys and interviews. We wrote the IRB proposal (mainly my professor did) using Cayuse, a web-based software package which helped simplify the preparation and electronic submission of proposals. It is still pending approval and feedback. my professor recommended that I start writing out my introduction, while we were waiting for approval, which I did! My professor also had a session with high school students again, so I attended and tried to help as a "teaching assistant". They were teaching the students graphics design with the use of roblox again, but this class size was smaller so people were more attentive. Also, no one needed help at the senior center on Friday but it was still fun because they brought in zoo animals for the senior citizens to look at and pet, and it was entertaining for me too. This weekend, my best friend also came to visit me so I had the chance to explain my whole project and show off parts of Purdue's campus, which was super fun!
