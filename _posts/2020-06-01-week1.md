Hi everyone! This is my blog post for the first week. So this week, I meet my professor Rua Williams and the graduate students in their lab. It was held over zoom because some of the students are working from home. I learned about all of the projects that they are currently engaged in; the department we are working in is Computer Graphics Technology, but everyone is involved in disability studies.
