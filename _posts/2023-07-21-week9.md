Week 9

This week, I finished up the introduction of the paper, and completed the surveys that are going to be sent out to the patients and physicians. My professor helped me come up with those questions, as well as the ones that will be used in the interviews. I am looking forward to sending them out and looking at the results, although due to the delay in getting the IRB approval and my travel back home, it might not be included fully in the paper that I submit. However, I will be adding them to my paper as soon as I can, and update my website with an updated paper as well! Its been really nice to be home, but is a different environment to be doing research in. I'm really enjoying it though!
