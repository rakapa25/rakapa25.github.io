Week 5

So for this week, my professor had me finish making the methods section for my paper. This wasn't a finalized methods section, but more like an attempt at it in order for my professor to help me develop how I would collect data samples on my topic. They also wanted to ensure that I was understanding how to write research questions as well as following the most logical ways to investigate my topic. At the end of the week, they sat me down and provided feedback, and helped me brainstorm more developed research questions.
