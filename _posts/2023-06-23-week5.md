Week 5

So for this week, my professor had me finish making the methods section for my paper. This wasn't a finalized methods section, but more like an attempt at it in order for my professor to help me develop how I would collect data samples on my topic. They also wanted to ensure that I was understanding how to write research questions as well as following the most logical ways to investigate my topic. My professor also had a session with high school students this week which I attended. I tried to help debug the code that the students had had written. The were teaching the students graphics design with the use of roblox. The class size was large so people were frequently distracted, but I hope they still took something from it. At the end of the week, my professor sat me down and provided feedback on the methods section I wrote, and helped me brainstorm more developed research questions. During our weekly meeting, I heard discussion on tips to write the IRB protocol in order to be able to conduct interviews and surveys for my topic. Additionally, on friday, my visit to the senior home was super fun because my professor and I got brunch too, and talked to the seniors together! I overall had a great week.
