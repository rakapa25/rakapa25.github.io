Week 1


Hi everyone! This is my blog post for the first week. So this week, I met my professor Rua Williams and the graduate students in their lab. First I got a mini orientation of the lab and my working space (I got my own office next to my professors for the summer!). The whole lab meeting is held over zoom on thursdays because some of the students are working from home. I learned about all of the projects that they are currently engaged in; the department we are working in is Computer Graphics Technology, but everyones projects have an element of disability studies. I began to work with one of the graduate students, Chorong, on her project which is dementia and joy, and how senior citizens work with technology. On fridays, she goes to the senior center here in West Lafayette from 1pm to 3pm. I will be accompanying her until she goes home for the summer, at which point I will begin to go alone. Overall, this week I was mainly engaged in readings, brainstorming possible research topics, and getting acquainted to the campus and the area around it. I'm feeling pretty excited about the future things I will be doing here.
